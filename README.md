# Number Guessing Game (C Language)

## Project Details
The Number Guessing Game is a console-based application developed using the C programming language.  
The game allows the user to guess a predefined secret number within a limited number of attempts.

After each guess, the program provides hints indicating whether the guessed number is too high or too low.  
The game ends when the user either guesses the correct number or uses all available attempts, resulting in a win or loss.

This project was developed using Visual Studio Code and managed with GitHub.

## Need of the Project
- To help beginners understand basic C programming concepts
- To practice loops, conditional statements, and user input
- To build logical thinking and problem-solving skills
- To demonstrate how simple games are developed using C
- To serve as a foundation for advanced programming projects

---

## Utility of the Project
- Useful for C programming beginners
- Suitable for college lab work and mini projects
- Can be extended into a more advanced game
- Demonstrates win/lose logic with hints
- Helps understand control flow and program structure

---

## Future Scope
- Generate a random secret number using the `rand()` function
- Add difficulty levels such as Easy, Medium, and Hard
- Allow the user to restart the game
- Display remaining attempts or score
- Add time-based challenges
- Convert the project into a GUI-based game

## Learnings from the Project
This project helped in understanding:
- Variables and constants in C
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Conditional statements (`if-else`)
- Taking user input using `scanf`
- Implementing game logic
- Handling win and loss conditions
- Writing clean and readable C code
- Using GitHub for version control
